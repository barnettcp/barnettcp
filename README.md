- 👋 Hi, I’m @GopherSlayer425
- 👀 I’m interested in data analysis and visualization, coding, machine learning, the outdoors, and more! I love to design and create thoughtfully across a wide range of interests.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning... Python, Machine Learning, Godot 4, Blender, Krita, Inkscape, LangChain, HuggingFace

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small projects that are geared towards fun

- 📫 @gopherslayer on Discord

- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him

- ⚡ Fun fact: I thought I wanted to be a software developer until I tried coding in community college. After getting a degree in mathematics and working with data in my career, I am just now learning that I really do enjoy coding.
